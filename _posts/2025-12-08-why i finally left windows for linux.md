## The Last Straw
So, what pushed me over the edge? AI. Specifically, Microsoft's insistence on pushing unwanted AI features onto my personal devices. So, after years of toying around with the idea, I finally took the leap and replaced Windows with Linux on my primary desktop.

About a month ago, I found myself reading the most recent release notes for Windows 11, and realized that almost every change or update was some AI feature. Sure, there were a few mentions of bug fixes and security patches, but everything else was "Copilot this" and "AI component that." That bothered me for two main reasons:
1. Privacy: remember Microsoft Recall? Exactly. I want my personal data and files to stay private, and having built-in AI agents with direct access to my system is the complete opposite of that.
2. Control over my personal devices: I don't want a bunch of AI features baked into the OS I use every day and not have the option to easily remove them. If I want to use AI, I'll choose the model myself.

## A Decade of Experimenting With Linux
I'm not new to the world of Linux. My first introduction to Linux was more than a decade ago, when a friend showed me his new installation of Ubuntu and I immediately wanted to learn more about it. I didn't know much about computers at the time, so I followed some online tutorials and ended up installing Ubuntu on an old desktop I had at home. It took me months to figure out how to boot back into Windows, because the Grub menu would glitch and only show me a blank screen. It's crazy looking back now and remembering how little I knew back then.

Since then, I have dual-booted several distros with Windows, run headless servers to host my homelab (including a full Proxmox server), and spun up countless Kali VMs for pentesting and school various projects. What I hadn't done, until now, is completely switch to Linux on my daily-driver desktop.

Why didn't I make the switch earlier? Good question! These are my three main reasons why I put off making the switch:
1. Gaming
2. Microsoft Office Suite

Subpar gaming performance on Linux was always a big deterrent for me. I'm not a huge gamer, but the games I played never performed as well on Linux as they did on Windows. I remember trying to play one game on Linux in 2017, after a Vulkan version of it was released, and the FPS tanking compared to running it on Windows. Now, after hearing about advancements in Linux gaming like [Proton](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton) and the [Steam Deck](https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck), I was willing to give gaming on Linux another shot. That same game now performs just as well on my computer running Linux as it does with Windows installed.

I used to rely heavily on Microsoft Office in school to write reports, but no longer have that need. LibreOffice works well enough for my personal needs these days, and the web version of Microsoft Office works much better than it used to. That being said, Excel is still the top-tier spreadsheet software in my opinion and I really miss using the native app. LibreOffice Calc just isn't as refined and smooth as Excel.

## Linux Mint Just...Works
I started off installing [Pop!_OS](https://system76.com/pop/) 22.04 from System76. It worked pretty well out of the box and I had no major issues. After a couple weeks I started to notice that it wasn't as refined as other distros I've used, and decided to switch to [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/) when I learned that the next release of Pop!_OS will use COSMIC DE (a custom desktop environment build by System76). I tested the beta release of it and didn't enjoy the COSMIC UI or the idea of using such a new DE that will inevitably have major bugs. 

Linux Mint was an easy choice for me. My first experience with it was around the time Linux Mint 18 (~2016) was released and I really enjoyed the simplicity of the distro. I installed Linux Mint 22.2 about a month ago and was pleased to find the same experience I remembered, just more refined. The best way I can summarize my experience is that the OS doesn't get in my way, which is exactly how I want it to be. The entire OS has been stable and smooth from the start, without me needing to tweak it in any major way to get good gaming performance or set up my development environment.


## The Path Forward
Overall, my transition to Linux has been fairly smooth and I don't see myself switching back to Windows anytime soon. I would reconsider my decision if Microsoft decided to let users completely opt out and remove their AI features, but I don't expect that to happen any time soon.

I'm not against AI. AI has a lot of practical use cases and is a regular part of my workflows. I just want to be able to choose when and where to use it, and most importantly, retain control over what personal data I'm giving AI.
